        <h1>Autonomor: The Philosophy of Self-Dominion</h1>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Autonomor is a philosophy of <strong>self-dominion</strong>, prioritizing autonomy, personal accountability, and mastery. It aligns with solipsism, recognizing that the world exists only through perception, yet asserts that meaning is self-determined. It does not embrace nihilism, as desire itself gives meaning, nor is it passive solipsism—it acknowledges perceived opposition as a shaping force.</p>

        <h2>2. Core Principles</h2>
        <h3>Autonomy as the True Existence</h3>
        <p>Self-awareness and accountability define true existence. To live without autonomy is to exist as an extension of external forces. Hesitation is a weakness, but questioning oneself sharpens awareness.</p>

        <h3>Respect for the Autonomy of Others</h3>
        <p>Autonomor acknowledges that individuals interact as forces that shape each other. True respect comes from recognizing another's autonomy, not from submission. Competition and conflict are inevitable but serve as tests of self-mastery.</p>

        <h3>Fate as a Scene, Not a Cage</h3>
        <p>Fate, much like in eternalism, is the stage upon which actions occur. The future may be set, but autonomy lies in how one moves within it. Struggle itself can be part of fate, making it not a restriction but a condition for proving one’s will.</p>

        <h3>Perception, Opposition, and Solipsism</h3>
        <p>If all reality is perception, does opposition truly exist? Autonomor acknowledges that challenges, whether real or self-created, are essential. Perceived opposition is as real as it needs to be to test autonomy.</p>

        <h3>Emotions as Instruments</h3>
        <p>Emotions are neither weaknesses nor obstacles; they are tools. Mastery over them leads to greater self-control. Regret, for example, can be a chain or a catalyst—what matters is whether it influences action or stagnation.</p>

        <h2>3. Applications of Autonomor</h2>
        <h3>Decision-Making</h3>
        <p>Every choice must reinforce autonomy. Inaction is also a decision, and thus, one must own it. Learning is inevitable, but applying that knowledge is what defines mastery.</p>

        <h3>Competition & Rivalry</h3>
        <p>Conflict is not an obstacle—it is a refining process. Opposition is not an enemy but a measure of self-dominion.</p>

        <h3>Fate & Determinism</h3>
        <p>While the future may be set, engaging with it fully is the only true exercise of autonomy.</p>

        <h3>Regret & Growth</h3>
        <p>Regret is a choice of shackles, but it can also be a guiding force. To be aware of one’s failures is to be armed for the future. Regret should not break an individual—it should sharpen them.</p>

        <h2>4. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Autonomor is a path of <strong>self-dominion</strong>, where freedom, struggle, and mastery define existence. Meaning is not given, but claimed. Fate is the scene, but the individual is the actor. To live without self-awareness and responsibility is to reject autonomy itself.</p>
