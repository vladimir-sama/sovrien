## Sovrien: The Philosophy of Self-Dominion

### Introduction

Sovrien is a path of **self-dominion**, where freedom, struggle, and mastery define existence. Meaning is not given, but claimed. Fate is the scene, but the individual is the actor. To live without self-awareness and responsibility is to reject autonomy itself.
